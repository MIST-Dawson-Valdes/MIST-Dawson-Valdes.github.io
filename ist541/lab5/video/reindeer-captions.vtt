00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Reindeer traditionally pull sleighs

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and have a popular reputation for red, glowing noses.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But behind this folklore, there is some surprising truth â€“

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
an ingenious adaptation, which helps them survive the extremes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Their noses are full of blood vessels.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
These cool warm air down as it leaves the body

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and warms cold air up as it comes in,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
keeping the reindeer's brain constantly warm and active.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, as the thermal camera proves,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
reindeer's noses are actually red.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's not just the nose of the reindeer which is extraordinary.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
How they view their winter surroundings

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
through those large, characterful eyes is truly astonishing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When it's bright and sunny like this,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
my eyes struggle to cope with the amount of

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
UV light that's coming from the sun

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and is bouncing back up off the snow.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If I was to spend too long here,
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'd eventually damage my eyes.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I could become snow-blind.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But reindeer, they see things differently.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Not only can they see in colour like I can,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
they can also see in ultraviolet.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
For us, it's difficult to make out detail

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
when the landscape is so white.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But with UV vision,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
a reindeer can see things in much greater contrast.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They can see shapes and detail that we can't.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The lichen on the trees which they eat,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
or animal urine in the snow, becomes more prominent.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In such a white, snowy world,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
it certainly helps to have that extra insight.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Reindeer even have specially designed flexible hooves.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In the winter, their four toes can spread out wide

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to act like snow shoes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This means they can walk on bumpy ice without slipping.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
However, on smooth ice

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
they can sometimes find their shoes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a little ill-suited.
